# EAFormCSS
The CSS for the employment application form

Since we cannot turn on the site-wide CSS option, CSS has to be added to
the application form. All of this CSS is specific to form 17, employment
application, so no other forms will be affected. This code is placed in
Appearances->Customize->Additional CSS. If it ever has to be undone, the
CSS can be deleted.
